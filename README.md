deep learning study notes
- Graph: "a tf computation, represented as a dataflow graph"
  - contains a set of tf.operation objects, which represents units of computation; and tf.sensor objects, which represent the   units of data that flow between operations.
- Modules: a collection of things: nouns & verbs, homogeneous & heterogeneous lists
  - to augment python we import modules
  - numpy library is not built-in and is numerical python
  - to install in iPython "import numpy as np" in terminal
  
 # ipython commands
 

## to do 
- Understand WaveGAN
- create tensorflow demo in colaboratory and git

- 3.13.19
- read through graph & session in tf docs
- look at built in functions in github

## links
- [tensorflow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf)
